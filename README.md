## Description
This project built a Multi-Layer Perception (“MLP”) model to classify the cells into 4 different categories, which are: “red blood cell”, “ring”, “schizont”, and “trophozoite.” The best model over the past seven-day data challenge competition has achieved a reasonable performance with a 0.6147 macro-averaged F1-score and 0.6212 Cohen’s Kappa Score. The average score of the two is 0.6179.
